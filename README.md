============

Fresh host setup / bootstrapping for Debian and derivatives.

DISCLAIMER: These scripts and configs set things up they way I like it, which
means you don't need to. I don't install things globally that I don't need to
be globally available, i.e. stuff ends up in $HOME more than is usually the 
case. All scripts are idempotent, i.e. you can call them as often as you like
and they still "do the right thing" (keeping existing things untouched or 
updating them). Even if you don't use the configs, the provided helper 
functions and install scripts might still be useful to roll your own setup.


TODO: HOW-TO


Tested for:
 * Debian 6 (Squeeze),
 * Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise),
 * anything you test it on, and report back to me.
